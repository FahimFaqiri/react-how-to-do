# react-show-views

* in this project i will create a fully responsive webpage which will be optimized for phones, tablets, laptops (M,S,L) and desktops. The main function of this webapp is to have how-to videos that visiters can learn from. After finish the UI i will add some data which will be fetched from and external api. This webpage will be deployed in firebase.

* This code will produce a fully responsive webpage that will showcase a number of how-to videos with some descriptions and with an login system.

* In this project i will use Javascript with the libraries React.js, globalstyles, and the themeprovider library.

* In the future i would love to share this webpage for usage, mostly entertainment.
